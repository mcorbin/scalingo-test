IT infrastructures are complex. We have more and more equipments, machines, and services to manage. Infrastructures are also more dynamic, with services which can be scaled up and down depending on usage.

The rise of containers orchestrators also made networking more complex. On a network failure, a service could be reachable from one part of your infrastructure but not from another one.

Cabourotte is a tool which allow you to execute healthchecks (HTTP(s), TCP, DNS, TLS including certificate expiration notice, arbitrary commands) on your infrastructure. It already supports various features including:

- Configurable by using a YAML file, or by using the API. Using the API allows you to dynamically add, update, or remove healthchecks definitions. The API also allows you to list configured healthchecks and to get the latest status for each healthcheck.
- Kubernetes service discovery: Cabourotte can automatically watches Kubernetes pods and services and configured healthchecks based on annotations on them.
- Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition: you can configure your healthchecks using a Kubernetes CRD.
- HTTP service discovery: You can easily integration Cabourotte with anything you want.
- Prometheus integration: the healthchecks results and executions time are exposed on a Prometheus endpoint alongside various internal metrics.
- Support exporters, which can be configured to push the healthchecks results to another systems.
- `One-Off` healthchecks: You can send requests to the API to execute arbitrary healthchecks and get the healthchecks results in the responses.
- Hot reload on a SIGHUP.
- A small frontend to see the current healthchecks status

Lightweight, written in Golang, Cabourotte can run everywhere to detect services and network failures.
